Website for passanger transportation business with a transparent customer-company-relationship.

Aim:
To create a platform allowing interaction between companies and customers in the public transportation branch. 
Note: The service's objective is not to copy existing website structures but to provide as much transparency for clients and companies as possible.

Background:
Using the existing websites for transportation logistics it is possible for companies to take assignments without any avaliability of buses or drivers. 
This results in the fact, that many people are working like brokers (they just handover assignements to other companies). Obviously this means, that  customers have no ensurance that their assignement will be fulfilled. Furthermore it no longer is up to the customer to choose the company executing the order and therefore the customer can't be certain about facing the expected quality of service.

Solution:
To fix that circumstances, we prepared several ideas, which will be discussed in this paragraph.
First of all we have to analyse and accept that fact that the responsibility for the offered service is in the service providers hands only. 
So it is on the companies to find a way to prove to be able to handle the logistic problem by reviewing and pointing out their capacities to take on assignements. How should they do it? Well,...this is where our idea comes to live. 


How?
- It's thinkable that u have to scan the registration document of the transportation vehicle.
- There should be alternative ways/interfaces for the customer to choose the company. #
[What alternative Ways? A UML chart and a GUI is gonna follow soon.]
